## Align_path 
Make a compare between two opensource project VINS and MSCKF. 1.Compute RMSE plot the changes of error. 2.Draw the result of their estimation and groundtruth in the same coordinate. 3.The color of trajectory changes With the changes of error.
########## Dependence
MATLAB R2016b
===========================================================================
## Line Restruction
According to real position and orientation of camera, compute the 3D position of line features in images. Then plot in MATLAB.
########## Dependence
MATLAB R2016b; OpenCV 3.1.0; 
ps: This project also depends on Eigen, G2O, and Sophus because I want it to be an odometry step by step.
